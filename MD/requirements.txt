# Improved Posture Detection System - Requirements
# NO machine learning libraries required!

# Core computer vision library (classical CV functions only)
opencv-python>=4.5.0

# Numerical operations
numpy>=1.19.0

# Optional: For better performance
# opencv-contrib-python>=4.5.0

# Note: This project deliberately does NOT use:
# - mediapipe (uses ML)
# - tensorflow (ML framework)
# - pytorch (ML framework)
# - scikit-learn (ML library)
# - keras (ML framework)

# Only basic CV techniques are used:
# - Haar cascades (pre-trained but classical)
# - Edge detection (Canny)
# - Contour analysis
# - Geometric calculations
# - Color space transformations
# - Morphological operations
