# Core dependencies for Vision-Based Ergonomic Posture Monitoring
opencv-python>=4.7.0
numpy>=1.23
pillow>=9.0.0

# Optional (improves landmark/keypoint detection; may have platform-specific wheel requirements)
# mediapipe>=0.10.0

# Notes:
# - Pillow is required for the Tkinter GUI (ImageTk). If Pillow is missing, the app falls back to the OpenCV window.
# - Mediapipe is optional. If you install it the project can be extended to use MediaPipe pose/face landmarks instead of the current heuristics.
